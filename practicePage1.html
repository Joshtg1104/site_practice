      <article> The name's Joshua Graham and I am a software engineer and a graphic designer.
        I consider myself an artist so I tend to be attracted to
        the artistic aspect of software and web design the most.
        I have skills in both frontend and backend software engineering but I prefer frontend as it allows me to
        implement my artistic skills in my coding. I am looking to aim more at social media and entertainment lines of
        work like video games, phone apps, and video streaming. Don't take that as a rejection of other lines of software
        engineering work though as I am open to all possibilities in order to improve my skils and increase my
        experience.</article>
